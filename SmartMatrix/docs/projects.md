# SmartMatrix Projects

## Aurora Display

The Aurora Display is a combination of SmartMatrix Shield, and an enclosure with an adjustable diffusion screen that can be separated from the RGB matrix panel. By putting the diffusion screen close to the panel, the screen shows a pixelated effect. By separating the diffusion screen from the panel, the individual pixels lose focus and blur together. The images that can be made with the out of focus panel donâ€™t look like they could be made by such a low resolution display.

Design credit for the enclosure goes to Al Linke's Pixel, which is where I got the idea for the dark acrylic in front with diffusion behind, nice-looking screw heads, and standoffs combination for this case.

### Assembly

Tools needed for assembling the Aurora Display enclosure  
    
- Phillips Screwdriver
- Knife or razor blade
- Needlenose Pliers (or 5.5mm hollow-shaft nut driver)
- Cloth - either lint-free or microfiber
- (optional) acrylic cleaner, or mild soap and water
- (optional) 2.5mm hex driver

The front screen of the enclosure is made from three layers: transparent gray acrylic for good color contrast, white polypropylene film for diffusion, and clear polycarbonate to hold the polypropylene film in place.  

> ![Layers](photos/AuroraAssembly/02-Layers.jpg)

A couple important things before starting:  
 - Any large dust trapped between the layers will show when light is shined through, so it is important to clear dust off of each layer before assembling.  
 - If the polypropylene film is creased, the crease will be visible, so be careful not to fold the film or use any tools that might pinch it while assembling.

Wipe the exposed side of acrylic with your cloth, and if you have any, use the acrylic cleaner on it.

The polypropylene film has two parts, a clear film and a while film that are attached at the four holes in the corners.  Peel the clear layer off and discard.

> ![Polypropylene Layers](photos/AuroraAssembly/04-PolyProLayers.jpg)

Wipe any dust off of one side of the while polypropylene film.  

> ![Cleaning Polypropylene](photos/AuroraAssembly/05-PolyProCleaning.jpg)

Add the polypropylene film on top of the acrylic with the two clean sides touching, and dust the other side of the polypropylene film.

The polycarbonate has a protective film on at least on one side.  There is usually one side that is very easy to remove (or is missing already), and a second side where it is difficult to find the edge that removes it from the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate will be crystal clear when the film is removed.  Use the tip of your knife or razor blade outside one of the four holes in the corner to lift the film from just that corner, and keep the rest on for now to protect the surface while assembling.

Put the protective film side down, and wipe any dust from the other side of the polycarbonate.

> ![Polycarbonate Cleaning](photos/AuroraAssembly/08-PolyCarbCleaning.jpg)

Add the polycarbonate to the pile of acrylic, polypropylene, with the film side up, so you have a plastic "sandwich" with protective coatings on the very top and bottom.  Find the corner with the loose polycarbonate protective film.  Insert one socket head cap screw through the acrylic, and the holes in the other plastics, but not through the polycarbonate protective film, so you can easily remove the film later.  Add a hex locknut to it, just loosely tightened with your fingers.

Repeat with the other three holes, but don't worry about the polycarbonate film, it will be separated later.

> ![Four Screws](photos/AuroraAssembly/10-FourNuts.jpg)

Grip the hex locknut with needlenose pliers, or if you have it, a 5.5mm hollow-shaft nut driver.  Tighten with the included 2.5mm hex key, or if you have it, a 2.5mm hex driver.

> ![Tightening Screw and Nut](photos/AuroraAssembly/11-TighteningScrewAndNut.jpg)

Once the nut and screw tighten around the plastic, unscrew it a bit so it is just loose enough to spin easily.  Repeat with the other three holes.

If you find the polycarbonate has bowed a bit and isn't lying flat along one of the edges, loosen the two screws on that edge and push flat with your fingers, then tighten again.

Use your knife to separate the paper backing from the two acrylic pieces that make up the back of the frame.

Pull on the paper to remove it completely.

Add the back pieces on top of your display as shown in the picture.  The white text printed on the back of the display is readable when the display is facing up, and the arrows on the back of the display point up and to the right.  The back pieces of the enclosure are unique:  the upper back piece has two mounting/hanging holes on it, and the lower back piece has one mounting/hanging hole and a slit.

> ![Back Enclosure](photos/AuroraAssembly/15-BackScrews.jpg)

Add two flathead screws to each back piece and use your phillips screwdriver to hand tighten.  Do not overtighten by using an electric screwdriver as this may cause the acrylic to crack.  There are eight mounting holes in the display but only four are used with the enclosure.  The others can be used to attach the display to another object.

Add a standoff and flathead screw to the four corners just loosely finger-tightening for now.  Repeat with the other three corners.

> ![Standoffs](photos/AuroraAssembly/16-FingerTighteningStandoffs.jpg)

Pull on the loose corner of the polycarbonate protective film toward one of the adjacent corners, and pull the film off from around that corner.  Repeat until the film is completely removed and discard.

> ![Removing Polycarbonate Film](photos/AuroraAssembly/17-RemovingCoating.jpg)

Add the front panel on top of the standoffs.  Tighten the screw in each corner about 10 half-turns with the allen key.  

> ![Tightening Front Panel](photos/AuroraAssembly/19-TighteningFrontPanel.jpg)

Flip the display over and tighten the screws in the corner with the screwdriver, again being careful not to overtighten with an electric screwdriver to avoid cracking the acrylic.

> ![Tightening Standoffs](photos/AuroraAssembly/20-TighteningStandoffs.jpg)

Use a fingernail if you can, or carefully use a knife, to separate the paper backing from the front of the display but avoid scratching as the front panel is visible.

> ![Removing Front Paper](photos/AuroraAssembly/22-RemovingFrontPaper.jpg)

You may have to pull some bits off the screws in the corners.

You can now add the SmartMatrix Shield to your display and adjust the height of the front panel to get the desired effect for the content you are displaying.
