# SmartLED Shield (formerly SmartMatrix Shield)

The SmartLED Shield (formerly SmartMatrix Shield) is the best way to connect the Teensy 3 to compatible Large RGB LED matrix display panels.  In combination with the SmartMatrix Library, you can create stunning LED visuals with just a few lines of code.

You can also use the prebuilt [Aurora software](https://github.com/pixelmatix/aurora) that creates an interactive display to play animated GIFs and patterns using the SmartLED Shield, for those who want to easily get started or don't want to write their own code.

The SmartMatrix Display is now a retired product, but you can build your own with a SmartLED Shield, Teensy, and [free instructions](http://www.instructables.com/id/SmartMatrix-Dynamic-LED-Art-Display/).

Customize what's on the screen with a remote control: choose what's playing, show a clock or message on top, and change settings, all from the remote. You don't need a computer or phone to control what's on the screen.
