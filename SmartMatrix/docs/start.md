# SmartMatrix Overview

SmartMatrix is a beautiful music visualizer, dynamic art display, video game art display, and more. It's controllable, customizable, and extendable, allowing you to display your own animations and messages.

Customize what's on the screen with the included remote control: choose what's playing, show a clock or message on top, and change settings, all from the remote. You don't need a computer or phone to control what's on the screen.

## SmartMatrix Shield
We prototyped SmartMatrix using our SmartMatrix Shield, the SmartMatrix Library and a Teensy 3.1.  The Shield and Library are open source, and you can use them to create your own projects.

The SmartMatrix Shield is the best way to connect the Teensy 3.1 to compatible Large RGB LED matrix display panels, and in combination with the SmartMatrix Library can create stunning LED visuals with just a few lines of code.  You can also use the prebuilt [Aurora software](https://github.com/pixelmatix/aurora) that creates an interactive display to play animated GIFs and patterns using the SmartMatrix Shield, for those who want to easily get started or don't want to write their own code.

The SmartMatrix Shield is available for purchase from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1902).  Compatible RGB matrix panels are available from Adafruit and linked from their SmartMatrix Shield product page.

The SmartMatrix Bundle - which comes with everything you need to build a display that can be mounted in a shadowbox picture frame and comes with a remote control to change what's playing - is available through the [Hackaday Store](http://store.hackaday.com/products/smartmatrix-bundle) with free worldwide shipping.
