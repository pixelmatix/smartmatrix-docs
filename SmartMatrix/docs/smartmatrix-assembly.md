# SmartMatrix Display Assembly

This [Assembly Video](https://vimeo.com/129599847) may help as a supplement to the pictures and text instructions.  The first few steps up through "Connect Ribbon Cable" are done already for you.

## IR Sensor Cable

The red/black/white leads line up to 3V3/Gnd/Data pins on the IR Receiver.  Use the pictures to make sure the receiver is inserted the right way.

It can be difficult to tell how far the leads are inserted into the connector.  This sensor has the leads covered with a black marker to the depth of the connector, about .19".  When inserted properly, you can't see the black marker anymore.  This can be a good way to tell if the sensor is inserted far enough.

It's much easier to insert the sensor when the leads are at an angle.  Point the leads so they are facing the all-white wall of the connector, not the side with the silver contacts visible.  Pointed this way, it should only take a little pressure and wiggling of the sensor before it goes in.  The leads will move in noticeably when positioned correctly.

You can braid the cable to keep it tidier.

Insert the loose ends into the 3-pin housing in the same Red/Black/White order as the other end of the cable.

Slide the end of the cable between the plastic frame and the the circuit board on the back side of the LED Matrix panel.

Plug the cable into the 3-pin connector on the SmartMatrix board, matching the colors of the cable to the labels on the board.  Make sure to route the cable around - not on top of - the 16 pin connector on the LED Matrix panel.

## Assembling Frame

Fold the tabs on the frame back and remove the back of the frame, SmartMatrix panel, divider, and frosted acrylic.

Remove the protective film from both sides of the frosted acrylic.  It may be difficult to start peeling the film, you can use the edge of a knife to separate the film from the acrylic at one of the corners to get started.

Set the acrylic into the frame

Hold the acrylic up to some light to look for any dust that will show up when backlit from the LEDs.  Clean off any dust before closing everything back up.

Add the divider to the frame

Set the MDF back of the frame, holding the IR sensor cable and making sure the cable is not pinched between the plastic and MDF.  The rounded dome of the IR sensor should be facing down toward the table.

Add the screws loosely to the panel.  It may take a little effort to push the MDF into position so the screws align, and you probably need to hold the MDF in place with one hand while adding the first screws.  In two corners, there are plastic alignment pins that need to go through the MDF.  Align those pins with the MDF and add the adjacent screws first.

Check the panel and MDF from the side to make sure they are fitting together, and there's nothing pinched between the panel and MDF.  On the side with the IR sensor, there will be a little gap where the SmartMatrix board screws and IR sensor push on the MDF a little bit.

Drop the panel into the frame.

Bend the leads of the IR sensor so the leads sit flat against the side of the frame.

When the leads are in position, tighten all four screws

Fold the tabs of the frame down to hold everything together

If you want to hang the frame on the wall, use the included rubber bumpers on the four corners of the frame to leave space for the power cable and connectors, and set the frame evenly against the wall.

## Remote Control

Pull the plastic tab at the bottom of the remote to connect the battery
