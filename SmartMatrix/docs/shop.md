SmartMatrix Display is now discontinued and not available for purchase, but you can build your own DIY version by following [our Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/SmartMatrix-Dynamic-LED-Art-Display/).


## SmartMatrix Bundle

The [SmartMatrix Bundle](http://store.hackaday.com/products/smartmatrix-bundle) was sold through our site, in person at Maker Faires, and through the Hackaday store, but is currently unavailable.   The Bundle includes everything needed to build a 32x32 RGB display that runs the Aurora software, and uses the SmartMatrix SD shield to make it easy to read content from a microSD card.  In addition to the parts needed to make a basic display, it includes a remote control and receiver, microSD card, and parts to mount the display in a shadow box picture frame.  The bundle can run the same software as the SmartMatrix Display, as described in [our Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/SmartMatrix-Dynamic-LED-Art-Display/).

## SmartMatrix SD Shield

The [SmartMatrix SD Shield](shield-sdv2.html) is discontinued, replaced by the SmartLED Shield V4.  The SmartMatrix SD Shield still works with the SmartMatrix Library and many projects can still use this shield.  Our main distributors have stopped carrying it and started carrying the SmartLED Shield V4 instead.
