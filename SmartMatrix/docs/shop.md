# Purchasing SmartMatrix

## SmartMatrix is on Kickstarter!
Please visit our [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixelmatix/smartmatrix-dynamic-led-art-display-and-music-visu) for more details on the finished product we're building, and the Instructables page linked from Kickstarter for details on how you can make one yourself with a SmartMatrix shield.

### SmartMatrix Bundle

The [SmartMatrix Bundle](http://store.hackaday.com/products/smartmatrix-bundle) includes everything needed to build a 32x32 RGB display that runs the Aurora software, and uses the SmartMatrix SD board to make it easy to read content from a microSD card.  In addition to the parts needed to make a basic display, it includes a remote control and receiver, microSD card, and parts to mount the display in a shadow box picture frame.
The bundle is only available from the [Hackaday Store](http://store.hackaday.com/products/smartmatrix-bundle) with free worldwide shipping.
