## SmartMatrix Bundle

The [SmartMatrix Bundle](http://store.hackaday.com/products/smartmatrix-bundle) was sold through our site, in person at Maker Faires, and through the Hackaday store, but is currently unavailable.   The Bundle includes everything needed to build a 32x32 RGB display that runs the Aurora software, and uses the SmartMatrix SD shield to make it easy to read content from a microSD card.  In addition to the parts needed to make a basic display, it includes a remote control and receiver, microSD card, and parts to mount the display in a shadow box picture frame.  The bundle can run the same software as the SmartMatrix Display, as described in [our Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/SmartMatrix-Dynamic-LED-Art-Display/).
The bundle is available from the [Hackaday Store](http://store.hackaday.com/products/smartmatrix-bundle) with free worldwide shipping.

## SmartMatrix Shield

The [SmartMatrix Shield](shield-v1.html) is no longer being manufactured, as it's been replaced with the SmartMatrix SD Shield.  The SmartMatrix Shield still works with the SmartMatrix Library and many projects can still use the original shield, as long as the RGB panel you have can be driven from 3.3V signals.  The original SmartMatrix Shield may still available from several distributors:
