## Specs and Shield Assembly

The [SmartMatrix SD Shield](shield-sdv2.html) page has details on specs and assembly.  The bundle includes an IR receiver which is connected to pin to the "18/IR" pin on the expansion header.  If you purchased a bundle from Maker Faire NYC or our Tindie store, you may have a [V1 SmartMatrix SD Shield](shield-sd.html), so refer to that page instead.

## SmartMatrix Bundle Accessories

### SmartMatrix Frame Kit

The first batch of paperboard has extra holes due to a miscommunication with the vendor.  It may take a little extra work to find the right holes.  Use the picture with the screws to see which holes to use.  Use the polarizing pins on the panel to guide the paperboard into the right place.

When routing the matrix power cable between the paperboard and the display, be careful of the sharp screws that protrude from the display.  Route the cable to avoid the screws so they do not impale the power cable when the paperboard is added.  You can also remove the screws, or clip them with diagonal cutters to be shorter and less sharp.

The shield rests on top of the paperboard at an angle.  If you want to keep the shield flat for a lower profile, you can cut the paperboard with a knife, then gently bend it down so the front of the shield can sit lower.

Start with the Shield plugged (loosely is fine) into the matrix data connector and the power cable routed the way you want it.  Unplug the Shield and feed it at an angle through the hold in the paperboard.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/3-IMG_6322.jpg) 

Seat the paperboard on the matrix panel, making sure the polarizing pins on the panel fit through holes in the paperboard, and the four screw holes in the corners are visible through other holes.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/4-IMG_6324.jpg) 

Make sure the cable is routed neatly under the paperboard and isn't kinked or sitting on top of a sharp screw in the panel.  Adjust the cable routing if necessary.  Press down a bit to hold the paperboard in place until you have added a screw in the upper right corner to hold it for you.

Tighten each screw until the paperboard is sitting flat against the panel and the top of the screw is flush with the paperboard

Remove the cover from the adhesive strip

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/7-IMG_6329.jpg) 

Insert the shield into the data connector and push the front edge down on the adhesive.  If you cut and bent down the adhesive a bit before adding the shield, the shield should sit fairly flat against the paperboard.

#### Compatible Frames
There are quite a few 8"x8" shadow box frames out there, but only two of them are recommended for use with the SmartMatrix Frame Kit based on fit and quality.

MCS makes a 1" deep frame that gives a pixelated effect when used with the frosted acrylic in the SmartMatrix Frame Kit.  It's available from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/MCS-Scrapbook-Shadowbox-8-Inch-40393/dp/B004L6G2RE/), and [other online stores](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/8413181197040904862), and may be available at local stores.  It's MCS item number 40393.  Jeff reports some A.C. Moore stores (East Coast) carry this frame.

Michaels makes a 1-1/4" deep frame that gives an abstract effect when used with the frosted acrylic in the SmartMatrix Frame Kit.  It's available from [Michaels.com](http://www.michaels.com/shadowbox-with-signature-mat-black-8x8in/10223090.html) as well as in most of their stores.

#### MCS Frame Installation

Of the two frames, this one is the easiest to install as it doesn't require any modification or tools.

Lift up the tabs on the back of the frame to remove the MDF panel

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/1-IMG_6241.JPG) 

Remove the MDF and paper.  We won't need these anymore.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/2-IMG_6243.JPG) 

Remove the divider, and carefully remove the glass as it has sharp edges.  We won't need the glass anymore either.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/3-IMG_6244.JPG) 

Remove the protective film from both sides of the frosted acrylic.  It may be difficult to start peeling the film, you can use the edge of a knife to separate the film from the acrylic at one of the corners to get started.  

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/09-IMG_6345.JPG) 

Set the acrylic into the frame

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/4-IMG_6245.JPG) 

Hold the acrylic up to some light to look for any dust that will show up when backlit from the LEDs.  Clean off any dust before closing everything back up.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/5-IMG_6247.JPG) 

Add the divider back to the frame.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/6-IMG_6248.JPG) 

Drop the display with the paperboard panel onto the divider, and close the tabs to hold everything together.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/7-IMG_6249.JPG) 

This frame doesn't come with a hanger (it was on the MDF).  You can use attach the included hanger and nails to the frame if you want to mount it on the wall.

#### Michaels Frame Installation

You will need some needle-nose pliers and something thin for prying (a paint scraper for example) for installation of this frame.

Lift up the tabs on the back of the frame to remove the MDF panel

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/02-IMG_6336.JPG) 

Remove the MDF and paper.  We won't need these anymore.
> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/03-IMG_6337.JPG) 

The divider is made up of four pieces nailed to the sides of the frame.  Insert something thin that can pry each piece from the side of the frame.  It doesn't take much force to separate the pieces.  

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/04-IMG_6339.JPG) 
> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/05-IMG_6340.JPG) 

Set the pieces aside, we will add them back later.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/06-IMG_6341.JPG) 

Now use needle-nose pliers to pull the nails from the sides of the frame.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/07-IMG_6342.JPG) 

Carefully remove the glass as it has sharp edges.  We won't need the glass anymore.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/08-IMG_6344.JPG) 

Remove the protective film from both sides of the frosted acrylic.  It may be difficult to start peeling the film, you can use the edge of a knife to separate the film from the acrylic at one of the corners to get started.  Set the acrylic into the frame

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/09-IMG_6345.JPG) 

Hold the acrylic up to some light to look for any dust that will show up when backlit from the LEDs.  Clean off any dust before closing everything back up.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/MCS/5-IMG_6247.JPG) 

Add the four divider pieces back to the frame.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/Frame/Michaels/10-IMG_6346.JPG)

Carefully drop the display with the paperboard panel onto the divider so the display panel is between the divider and the paperboard is resting on top, without knocking over any of the divider pieces.  Close the tabs to hold everything together.

### IR Remote Kit

The red/black/white leads line up to 3V3/Gnd/Data pins on the IR Receiver.  Use the pictures to make sure the receiver is inserted the right way.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/1-IMG_6349.jpg) 

It can be difficult to tell how far the leads are inserted into the connector.  This sensor has the leads covered with a black marker to the depth of the connector, about .19".  When inserted properly, you can't see the black marker anymore.  This can be a good way to tell if the sensor is inserted far enough.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/IMG_6417.jpg) 

It's much easier to insert the sensor when the leads are at an angle.  Point the leads so they are facing the all-white wall of the connector, not the side with the silver contacts visible.  Pointed this way, it should only take a little pressure and wiggling of the sensor before it goes in.  The leads will move in noticeably when positioned correctly.  

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/IMG_6419.jpg) 

It's possible to push the sensor in too far, so the leads are sticking out the other side.  This will work, but is more of a risk for shorting something out or damaging the cable.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/IMG_6420.jpg) 

You can trim the leads before sliding into the connector if you want the sensor to be closer to the connector.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/3-IMG_6352.jpg) 

You can braid the cable to keep it tidier.  

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/4-IMG_6353.jpg)

Insert the loose ends into the 3-pin housing in the same Red/Black/White order as the other end of the cable.

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/5-IMG_6356.jpg)
> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/6-IMG_6357.jpg)

Use the colors to add the IR receiver cable to the correct pins on the SmartMatrix SD Shield.  
(Red = 3V3, Black = GND, White = IR)

> ![title](photos/SdAssembly/IR/IMG_6415.jpg)

The battery compartment can be tricky to open.  Use one fingernail to move the tab inward.  At the same time, use your thumbnail to pull the tray outward.
