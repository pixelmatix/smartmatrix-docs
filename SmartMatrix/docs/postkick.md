# SmartMatrix After Kickstarter
Our Kickstarter campaign ended, but the SmartMatrix project isn't over.  We're selling the SmartMatrix units we already built, with free shipping to the US, while supplies last:

Please join our list to find out when SmartMatrix is available outside the US. We'll extend a discount to non-US customers on the list when we do our wider release:  [SmartMatrix Non-US Waiting List](http://eepurl.com/bnEwKv)

If you know how to solder you can put together a SmartMatrix display yourself.  Check out our [Instructable](www.instructables.com/id/SmartMatrix-Dynamic-LED-Art-Display/), or the [shop page](shop.html) to find out where you can buy the SmartMatrix Shield.
