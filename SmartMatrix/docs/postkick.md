# SmartMatrix After Kickstarter
Our Kickstarter campaign ended, but the SmartMatrix project isn't over.

We will be selling the beta units we already built, check back here on Wednesday June 17 for a link, or check your email if you were a Kickstarter backer.

If you know how to solder you can put together a SmartMatrix display yourself.  Check out our Instructable, or the shop page to find out where you can buy the SmartMatrix Shield.

Please join [our mailing list]() to get the latest updates on SmartMatrix.  [Join us in the forums]() if you'd like to have a conversation.
